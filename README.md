# NioChat #
A project I made with the Java NIO during courses as homework

## The Task ##
* Server and Client architecture - several client can be connected at the same time
* Clients are authenticated via usernames and passwords - each username is unique and can be used by a single client at a time
* Messages from a user a sent to all other connected users, while the sender receives a status message from the server
* Clients can upload and download files
* Clients can view a list of all files currently uploaded to the server (by typing "/fileList")

## Tools ##
* JDK 1.8
* IntelliJ IDEA 14
